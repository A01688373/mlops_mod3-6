# Deliverable: Pre-Commits

Instructor: Carlos Mejia
Student: Gabriela SÃ¡nchez

Pre-Commits are a software development practice that consists of performing a series of automatic checks before committing changes to a version control repository.

These checks are carried out to ensure code quality and prevent the introduction of bugs into the code base.

In this deliverable, it is expected that pre-commits will be integrated into the project, which integrate the following validations:
1. Automatic ordering of imports.
2. Automatic removal of unused imports.
3. Linting and Formatting integration (modify code automatically to meet common PEP8 standards).
